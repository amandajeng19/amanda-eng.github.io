# This is my digital portfolio for the course IAT 355: Introduction to Visual Analytics at Simon Fraser University.

Led by Dr. Alireza Karduni and teaching assistant Mehdi Jahani, IAT 355 covers the basics of using Tableau, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to effectively create and analyze interactive data visualizations.

The purpose of this site is create a professional online presence to publish my work for IAT 355. To build the site, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git/GitHub.
- The "Index/Home" page includes descriptions of me (Amanda Eng), my professional and educational background, my personal interests, and my contact information.
- The "Visualizations" page displays interactive visualizations, made using Tableau.
