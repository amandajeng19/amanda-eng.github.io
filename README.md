# IAT 355 Personal Website

by Amanda Eng

This is my digital portfolio for the course IAT 355: Introduction to Visual Analytics at Simon Fraser University. Led by Dr. Alireza Karduni and teaching assistant Mehdi Jahani, IAT 355 covers the basics of using Tableau, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to effectively create and analyze interactive data visualizations.

The purpose of this site is create a professional online presence to publish my work for IAT 355. To build the site, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git/GitHub.

- The "Index/Home" page includes descriptions of me (Amanda Eng), my professional and educational background, my personal interests, and my contact information.
- Each assigment has a separate folder.
- The `fonts.css` file and the fonts folder are used to display my chosen font, Vend Sans.
- The `main.js` and `vis.js` files within each assignment folder are used to add interactivity to the index and visualizations pages, respectively.
