            The year the game was released. The release dates span from
            1980–2020. However, 2018 and 2019 are missing from the list.

            Action games (3,316) were by far the top genre sold, followed by
            Sports (2,346). Puzzle (582) and Strategy (681) games were the least
            common genre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Puzzle and Strategy are <i>my</i> favourite game types — I enjoy
            solving logic and word puzzles. I am fairly introverted, and I
            wonder if I prefer this gaming style because it’s usually more
            independent/solitary.

            Also, 203 games have an Unknown publisher, and 58 games are listed

          <h4>
            Question A: Which video game genres had the highest sales globally?
          </h4>
          <div class="container">
            <div id="view2-1-A"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The Action and Sports genres had the top sales, and the Puzzle,
            Adventure, and Strategy genres had the fewest.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was interesting to compare this chart to the distribution of
            games by genre (<a href="#1-4-genre">Section 1.4</a>):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lots of Adventure games were released, but they only sold
              moderately in quantity.
            </li>
            <li>
              A moderate number of games were listed as Miscellaneous, but
              they’re the third-most category for global sales. Perhaps
              uniqueness has a correlation with popularity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            Question B: Which gaming platforms had the highest sales globally?
          </h4>
          <div class="container">
            <div id="view2-1-B"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The PS2 had by far the highest game sales, followed by Xbox360 and
            PS3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doing a similar comparison with the game distribution by platform
            (<a href="#1-2-platform">Section 1.2</a>), I noticed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The quantity of games released for PS2 and DS are similarly high,
              yet actual sales for PS2 games was significantly higher.
            </li>

            top-selling gaming platforms?
          </h4>
          <div class="container">
            <div id="view2-2-A"></div>
          </div>
          <p>The peak sale years for a few notable games were as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PS: 1998</li>
            <li>PS2: 2002 &amp; 2004</li>
            <li>DS: 2005, 2007, &amp; 2008</li>
            <li>Xbox360: 2008 &amp; 2010</li>
            <li>Wii: 2008 &amp; 2009</li>
            <li>PS3: 2011</li>
            <li>PS4: 2015</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These results don't really surprise me — I remember the Wii versus
            Xbox preference debates when I was in elementary school around
            2008–2010.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, no matter how big, most platforms drop off about 5–10 years
            after their initial release. I suppose the hype for them dies down,
            and the next big concole comes along.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Question B: What were the peak sale years and trends for the
            top-selling genres?
          </h4>
          <div class="container">
            <div id="view2-2-B"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The top selling genres (Action, Sports) didn't really reach any
            peaks until the early-mid 2000s. For example, Sports game sales more
            than doubled between 2005 and 2006, while Action games had a major
            peak in 2002 and a bigger peak in 2008–2009. I’m guessing games in
            this games required a lot of dexterity and quick reaction times, and
            it took the passing of the 21st century for vido game technology to
            reach that level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Puzzle games and Platformers had minor peaks all through
            the 1980–2020 period yet remained somewhat low/consistent, never
            reaching the levels that the top genres did. I think these ones
            require more thoughtfulness and mental problem solving to play, so
            the improvements in technology don't make as much of a difference.
